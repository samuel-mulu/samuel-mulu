# 👋 Hello, I'm samuel mulu

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a passionate **Full-Stack & Mobile Developer** who builds modern, scalable, and user-focused applications.

On the web side, I specialize in the **MERN stack** — crafting robust backends with **Node.js** & **Express.js**, efficient databases with **MongoDB**, and dynamic frontends with **React.js** & **Next.js**.

Beyond the web, I also develop elegant **Flutter** mobile apps and work with **Laravel** for PHP-based solutions. My goal is to transform ideas into seamless digital experiences that solve real-world problems.
